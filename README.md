# Infinite Markets

This repository contains a simple SwiftUI app that displays a random "Infinite Market" card each time it launches. The data comes from `Curated_Infinite_Markets_40.csv` and is hardcoded into the app so it runs fully offline.

## Building the iOS App

1. Open the `InfiniteMarketsApp` folder in Xcode.
2. Build and run on an iOS device or simulator.

Every launch will show a random card describing a market opportunity, why it is "infinite", example applications and notable companies.
